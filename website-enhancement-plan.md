    *   Navigation clarity.
    *   Use of typography and whitespace.
    *   Subtle, meaningful animations.

## 4. Phase 1: Landing Page Frontend Enhancement Plan

### A. Visual Identity & System Refresh

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   ~~Refine the existing palette, establishing **Green** as the primary color focus, complemented by neutrals and potentially secondary accents like Amber (`#F59E0B`) or Navy (`#1E3A8A`), ensuring a sophisticated and cohesive feel.~~
    *   ~~Define distinct primary (green shades), secondary, accent, and neutral shades (light & dark variations) for both light/dark modes.~~
    *   ~~Ensure *all* text/background combinations meet WCAG AA contrast minimums, aiming for AAA where possible.~~
    *   ~~Use tools like Coolors or Realtime Colors for palette generation and testing.~~
*   **Typography:**
    *   ~~Solidify font pairing: Geist Sans for UI/body, Playfair Display for headings/accents. Evaluate alternatives if needed for stronger brand fit.~~
    *   Establish a strict typographic scale (e.g., using a tool like Typescale.com) for H1-H6, body text, captions, buttons, blockquotes. Define responsive font sizes.
    *   Fine-tune line heights, letter spacing, and paragraph spacing for optimal readability and visual rhythm.
*   **Iconography:**
    *   Consistently use Lucide Icons (default with Shadcn) for UI elements. Ensure icons are clear and appropriately sized.

### B. Layout & Structural Refinement

*   **Grid & Spacing:**
    *   Implement a consistent 8px grid system (or similar) for margins, padding, and element spacing using Tailwind config.
    *   Define max container widths and responsive padding rules.
*   **Header Enhancement:**
    *   **Keep Nested Container Style:** Refine the existing glassmorphism/nested container effect for better visual hierarchy and performance.
    *   **Navigation:** Improve clarity of main navigation items. Consider sticky behavior refinements or subtle transformations on scroll (Framer Motion). Enhance mobile navigation drawer UX/UI.
    *   **Logo:** Ensure the Logo component is crisp and scales appropriately.
*   **Hero Section Redesign:**
    *   **Goal:** Immediately capture attention and convey Elis's core value proposition.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   Compelling Headline (Playfair Display).
        *   Concise, engaging Sub-headline/Tagline (Geist Sans).
        *   High-quality, professional Author Photo (consider background removal or creative framing).
        *   Prominent primary CTA button (e.g., "Explore Services", "Discover My Books").
    *   **Animation:** Subtle entrance animations for text/image (Framer Motion fade-in/slide-up). Potential subtle background effect (gradient, particle).
*   **Section Flow & Structure:**
    *   Review and optimize the order of landing page sections. Suggested flow:
        1.  Hero Section
        2.  Brief "About Me" Teaser (leading to full About page)
        3.  Featured Books/Latest Work (Visually appealing cards)
        4.  Services Overview (Clear summaries, leading to details)
        5.  Testimonials/Social Proof (Compelling quotes/logos)
        6.  Newsletter Signup / Secondary CTA
        7.  Footer

### C. Component Styling & Customization (Shadcn + Custom)

*   **Shadcn Theme Overhaul:**
    *   Go beyond basic color variable changes. Deeply customize Shadcn components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Accordion`, etc.) using CSS variables and Tailwind `@apply` directives in `globals.css` or a dedicated theme file. Match the refined visual identity perfectly.
    *   Focus on `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, hover/focus states, padding, and typography within components.
*   **Card Component Redesign (Books/Services):**
    *   Create visually rich cards. Use `OptimizedImage`. Combine imagery, clear titles (Playfair), concise descriptions (Geist), and relevant CTAs/links.
    *   Implement subtle hover effects using Framer Motion (e.g., slight scale-up, shadow change, gradient shift).
*   **Button Styling:**
    *   Define distinct styles for primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons (filled, outlined, text).
    *   Ensure clear hover, focus, and active states with smooth transitions (Framer Motion).
*   **Forms (Newsletter):**
    *   Style input fields, labels, and buttons for clarity, usability, and aesthetic consistency with the overall design. Provide clear focus states and validation feedback.

### D. Interactivity & Meaningful Animation (Framer Motion)

*   **Entrance Animations:** Apply subtle fade-in/slide-up animations to sections or key elements as they scroll into view (`whileInView`). Keep duration short (e.g., 0.3s - 0.5s).
*   **Microinteractions:**
    *   Button hover effects (scale, background change).
    *   Card hover effects (as described above).
    *   Smooth accordion open/close.
    *   Subtle visual feedback on form submission/validation.
*   **Avoid Overuse:** Animations should enhance UX, not distract. Ensure they are performant and not jarring.

### E. Content & Imagery Polish

*   **Image Optimization:** Ensure all images are high-resolution, appropriately sized, compressed (using tools like Squoosh or Next/Image optimization), and use modern formats (WebP/AVIF).
*   **Copy Review:** Refine all landing page text for clarity, impact, and alignment with Elis's brand voice. Check for grammar and spelling errors.

### F. Responsiveness & Accessibility Foundation

*   **Rigorous Testing:** Test thoroughly on various screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet portrait/landscape, mobile). Use browser developer tools for emulation.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Maintain semantic HTML structure (use `h1`-`h6`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, `footer` appropriately).
    *   Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements.
    *   Verify sufficient color contrast (using dev tools or online checkers).
    *   Add ARIA attributes where necessary, especially for custom interactive components.
    *   Test with screen readers periodically (VoiceOver, NVDA).

## 5. Implementation Notes

*   Work incrementally, section by section or component by component.
*   Commit changes frequently with clear messages.
*   Regularly test responsiveness and accessibility.
*   Keep components modular and reusable.

## 6. Next Steps (Post-Landing Page)

*   Detailed design and implementation for inner pages (About, Blog, Shop, Services, Contact).
*   Refinement of e-commerce/booking functionality UX.
*   Potential backend integrations or improvements.
*   Advanced performance tuning (bundle analysis, code splitting).
*   Comprehensive SEO strategy implementation.
