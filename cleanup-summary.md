# Website Cleanup Project Summary

## Accomplished

### Phase 1: Initial Cleanup (Completed April 7, 2024)
- Removed 11 unused components from the codebase:
  - `AboutAuthor.tsx`
  - `Hero.original-backup.tsx`
  - `HeroLanding.tsx` 
  - `OldLandingPage.jsx`
  - `FeaturedBooks.tsx`
  - `ContactForm.tsx`
  - `AuthorProfile.tsx`
  - `RecentPosts.tsx` 
  - `AuthorCTA.tsx`
  - `BookTimeline.tsx`
  - `AuthorTimeline.tsx`
- Cleaned up unnecessary imports in various files
- Created tracking system for cleanup progress

### Phase 2: Component Consolidation (In Progress)
- Analyzed component usage across the application to identify duplicate/similar implementations
- Consolidated duplicate FlipCard implementations:
  - Enhanced `flip-card.tsx` to support multiple usage patterns with a `simpleMode` property
  - Updated dependent components to use the consolidated version
  - Removed redundant `animata/card/flip-card.tsx` implementation
- Consolidated error handling components:
  - Combined functionality from `ErrorFallback.tsx` and `error-fallback.tsx` into a new unified `error-boundary.tsx`
  - Enhanced with better UI, dark mode support, improved error details, and i18n
  - Added support for both full-page errors and component-level error boundaries
- Developed documentation for App Router migration path

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Consolidation**
   - Identify other duplicate UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
   - Standardize naming conventions using kebab-case for UI components
   - Create catalog of reusable components

2. **Optimize CSS and Style Definitions**
   - Review and consolidate duplicate style definitions
   - Move inline styles to component-level or global stylesheets
   - Ensure consistent use of Tailwind utility classes

3. **Begin App Router Migration Preparation**
   - Start restructuring folder organization to match App Router conventions
   - Update metadata handling for key pages
   - Test Server Components compatibility with existing code

## Impact of Changes

- **Reduced Code Size**: Removal of approximately 13 unused files, reducing codebase size by over 150KB
- **Simplified Codebase**: Clear component structure with less duplication and more consistent patterns
- **Improved Maintainability**: Consolidated components are easier to update and enhance
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better organization makes the codebase more approachable for new developers
- **Better Error Handling**: New unified error boundary system provides consistent error handling across the application

## Current Project State

The website is currently using the Pages Router pattern with some initial preparation for App Router migration. We're systematically removing unused code and consolidating duplicate functionality to prepare for the migration.

The cleanup process is iterative, with each step carefully documented in progress.md to track changes and ensure no functionality is broken.
