# UI Finalization Plan

## Design Philosophy
- **Container-First:** Maintain clean, contained layouts that prioritize content and usability
- **Subtle Interactions:** Focus on meaningful micro-interactions rather than heavy animations
- **shadcn/ui Consistency:** Leverage and extend shadcn/ui components for a cohesive look

## Implementation Guidelines

### UI Principles
1. **Container Boundaries**
   - Maintain consistent max-width
   - Proper padding at breakpoints
   - Clear content hierarchy

2. **Interaction Design**
   - Instant feedback on actions
   - Clear hover/focus states
   - Simple loading states
   - Subtle transitions (max 200ms)

3. **Component Patterns**
   ```tsx
   // Example component structure
   const Section = () => {
     return (
       <section className="relative w-full py-12 md:py-16">
         <div className="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6">
           <div className="relative space-y-8">
             {/* Content */}
           </div>
         </div>
       </section>
     )
   }
   ```

### Styling Guidelines
1. **Spacing**
   - Consistent padding: `p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8`
   - Section spacing: `py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-20`
   - Grid gaps: `gap-4 md:gap-6`

2. **Colors**
   - Use shadcn/ui color tokens
   - Maintain light/dark theme compatibility
   - Use accent colors sparingly

3. **Typography**
   - Clear hierarchy with consistent spacing
   - Mobile-optimized font sizes
   - Proper line heights for readability

### Performance Considerations
1. **Loading Strategy**
   - Optimize image loading
   - Implement proper lazy loading
   - Use simple loading states

2. **Interaction Performance**
   - Debounce search/filter functions
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Minimize layout shifts
