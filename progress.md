--- 

**2024-07-25:**

*   **Visual Identity - Color Palette:** Updated CSS variables (`:root`, `.dark`) in `src/styles/globals.css` to implement a new primary color theme based on Green (Emerald), with Slate neutrals, following client requirements. (Plan Section 4.A)
*   **Visual Identity - Typography:** Updated `src/styles/globals.css` to set base body font to Geist Sans and base heading font to Playfair Display. Commented out specific h1-h3 size rules to rely on Tailwind utilities/plugin. (Plan Section 4.A) 

**2024-07-26:**

*   **Navigation Improvements:** Simplified navigation structure by removing unused components (`Navbar.tsx`, `HeroNavbar.tsx`, `navbar-theme-toggle.tsx`) and focusing on the Header component. (Navbar Improvement Plan)
*   **Navbar Standardization:** Updated navigation components with consistent styling, replacing hardcoded colors with Tailwind's primary color variables:
    * Updated `NavLink.tsx` with consistent styling and framer-motion animations
    * Enhanced `DesktopNavigation.tsx` with standardized buttons and smooth animations
    * Improved `MobileNavigation.tsx` with consistent styling, better animations, and rounded corners
    * Ensured all interactive elements use the same corner radius (`rounded-lg`)
    * Implemented consistent hover effects and active states across all navigation items
*   **Dropdown Display Fix:** Fixed navigation dropdown menus that were displaying behind the hero container:
    * Updated z-index in `NavigationMenuContent` components to `z-[60]`
    * Fixed z-index in `NavigationMenuViewport` to ensure proper stacking
    * Ensured consistent z-index handling throughout header components
