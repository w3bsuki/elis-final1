# Project Progress Log

This file tracks significant changes, optimizations, and completed tasks during the website enhancement project.

--- 

**2024-07-25:**

*   **Visual Identity - Color Palette:** Updated CSS variables (`:root`, `.dark`) in `src/styles/globals.css` to implement a new primary color theme based on Green (Emerald), with Slate neutrals, following client requirements. (Plan Section 4.A)
*   **Visual Identity - Typography:** Updated `src/styles/globals.css` to set base body font to Geist Sans and base heading font to Playfair Display. Commented out specific h1-h3 size rules to rely on Tailwind utilities/plugin. (Plan Section 4.A) 

**2024-07-26:**

*   **Navigation Improvements:** Simplified navigation structure by removing unused components (`Navbar.tsx`, `HeroNavbar.tsx`, `navbar-theme-toggle.tsx`) and focusing on the Header component. (Navbar Improvement Plan)
*   **Navbar Standardization:** Updated navigation components with consistent styling, replacing hardcoded colors with Tailwind's primary color variables:
    * Updated `NavLink.tsx` with consistent styling and framer-motion animations
    * Enhanced `DesktopNavigation.tsx` with standardized buttons and smooth animations
    * Improved `MobileNavigation.tsx` with consistent styling, better animations, and rounded corners
    * Ensured all interactive elements use the same corner radius (`rounded-lg`)
    * Implemented consistent hover effects and active states across all navigation items
*   **Dropdown Display Fix:** Fixed navigation dropdown menus that were displaying behind the hero container:
    * Updated z-index in `NavigationMenuContent` components to `z-[60]`
    * Fixed z-index in `NavigationMenuViewport` to ensure proper stacking
    * Ensured consistent z-index handling throughout header components

   - ✅ Removing the unused FlipCard.tsx file
2. Continue Phase 1 & Start Phase 2:
   - Complete consolidation of the remaining FlipCard implementations
   - Check for other duplicate components that need consolidation
   - Identify and remove unused utility files and hooks
3. Prepare for Phase 3:
   - Start analyzing the import tree and dependencies
   - Identify unused imports across files
4. Begin analyzing the App Router migration path

## Detailed Notes

### Phase 1: Remove Unused Files & Components (In Progress)

We've started the cleanup process by:
1. Creating a comprehensive cleanup plan (website-cleanup-plan.md)
2. Identifying actively used components vs. unused ones
3. Removing the first batch of unused components/imports
4. Setting up this progress tracking system

Initial observations:
- The codebase has several backup or duplicate components that can be safely removed
- There's significant duplication between different UI component implementations
- We need to carefully analyze the relationship between Pages Router and App Router code

### FlipCard Components Analysis

We've discovered three different FlipCard implementations:

1. **`src/components/ui/FlipCard.tsx`** (capital F):
   - Feature-rich with Framer Motion animations
   - Good organization and styling
   - ✅ REMOVED - Was not imported anywhere in the codebase

2. **`src/components/ui/flip-card.tsx`** (lowercase f):
   - Uses Next.js Image component for better image optimization
   - Good accessibility features
   - Used in main sections: BooksSection and ServicesSection
   - ✅ ENHANCED - Now supports both usage patterns with a simpleMode flag

3. **`src/components/animata/card/flip-card.tsx`**:
   - Simpler implementation with less features
   - Used in AllBooks, DigitalBooks, and Bestsellers components
   - ✅ COMPONENTS UPDATED - All components now import from ui/flip-card.tsx
   - ✅ REMOVED - File deleted after all references were updated

**Consolidation Status:**
1. ✅ Removed the unused `FlipCard.tsx` (capital F) implementation
2. ✅ Enhanced the lowercase `flip-card.tsx` to support all use cases with a `simpleMode` flag
3. ✅ Updated imports in components using the animata version:
   - AllBooks.tsx
   - Bestsellers.tsx
   - DigitalBooks.tsx
4. ✅ Removed the now-unused animata/card/flip-card.tsx file
5. ⬜ Final testing to ensure all functionality works correctly

### Next Steps

1. Continue with Phase 1 by:
   - ✅ Removing the Hero.original-backup.tsx file
   - ✅ Checking for other unused section components
   - ✅ Starting to identify duplicate UI components (like flip-card.tsx vs FlipCard.tsx)
   - ✅ Removing the unused FlipCard.tsx file
2. Continue Phase 1 & Start Phase 2:
   - Complete consolidation of the remaining FlipCard implementations
   - Check for other duplicate components that need consolidation
   - Identify and remove unused utility files and hooks
3. Prepare for Phase 3:
   - Start analyzing the import tree and dependencies
   - Identify unused imports across files
4. Begin analyzing the App Router migration path
