# Website Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of our website refactoring and cleanup efforts based on the [website-component-inventory.md](./website-component-inventory.md) plan.

## Completed Tasks

### April 8, 2023

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Created comprehensive component inventory
   - Identified problematic structure issues
   - Documented key problems to address
   - Outlined recommended refactoring actions

2. **Documentation**
   - Created website-component-inventory.md with detailed analysis
   - Set up this progress tracking document

### April 9, 2023

1. **Remove Unused Files & Components**
   - [x] Deleted empty file: `src/components/animata/hero/hero-section.tsx`
   - [x] Removed duplicate Footer implementation from `src/components/sections/Footer.tsx`
   
2. **Footer Cleanup**
   - [x] Reviewed both footer implementations
   - [x] Chose to keep the layout/Footer.tsx implementation (more complete, better styled, and uses motion)
   - [x] Removed duplicate implementation from sections/Footer.tsx

3. **Hero Section Refactoring**
   - [x] Created new organized files with proper code structure:
     - [x] `src/components/sections/home/index.tsx` - Main HomePage component (replaces Hero.tsx)
     - [x] `src/components/sections/home/hero-section.tsx` - Hero section implementation
   - [x] Updated homepage to use new components
   - [x] Ensured 100% visual parity with original implementation

## In Progress

1. **Component Organization**
   - [ ] Add additional section components to home directory
   - [ ] Extract reusable components from large files
   - [ ] Apply naming conventions to all components

## Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 1: Remove Unused Files & Components
- [ ] Remove backup files (Hero.original-backup.tsx) if found
- [ ] After confirming the new implementation works correctly, deprecate old implementations
- [ ] Clean up unused imports across codebase

### Phase 2: Consolidate Duplicate Functionality
- [ ] Standardize navigation implementation
- [ ] Merge/standardize card implementations
- [ ] Standardize dialog implementations

### Phase 3: Break Down Large Components
- [ ] Refactor checkout.tsx (961 lines)
- [ ] Break down BooksSection.tsx (625 lines)
- [ ] Extract more sub-components from the hero section

### Phase 4: Standardize Component Organization
- [ ] Establish consistent folder/file naming convention
- [ ] Reorganize component file structure
- [ ] Apply consistent imports pattern

### Phase 5: Prepare for App Router Migration
- [ ] Identify server vs client components
- [ ] Plan directory structure for App Router
- [ ] Start migrating core layout components

## Technical Decisions

### Component Structure Standard
- Complex components with sub-components: Use folders with index.tsx
- Simple components: Use individual files with kebab-case naming
- All component files should use .tsx extension

### File Size Limitations
- Component files should not exceed 300 lines
- Larger components must be broken down into sub-components

### Naming Conventions
- File names: kebab-case.tsx (e.g., hero-section.tsx)
- Component names: PascalCase (e.g., HeroSection)
- Folder names: kebab-case (e.g., hero-section/)
- Section components organized by page (e.g., home/hero-section.tsx)

## Refactoring Metrics

| Category | Before Refactoring | Current | Target |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| Total components | 75+ | 74+ | 50-60 |
| Components >300 lines | 12 | 12 | 0 |
| Duplicate implementations | 5 | 4 | 0 |
| Empty/unused files | 3+ | 2+ | 0 |
| New organized components | 0 | 2 | 30+ |

## Notes

- Priority should be given to consolidating the hero section implementations as they are central to the site
- Large page components like checkout.tsx need urgent refactoring for better maintainability
- App Router migration should only begin after major component cleanups are complete
- The layout/Footer.tsx implementation is the preferred one as it has better styling, animations, and is more complete
- Our refactoring approach is to create new, well-organized files and then migrate to them while maintaining identical visual appearance
